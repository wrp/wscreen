                  ----------------------------
                   What's new in screen-3.9 ?
                  ----------------------------

* real multiuser support
    A window can now be displayed on more than one attached displays.
    Screen does all the necessary clipping if the window size doesn't
    fit the display.
    New command:
      ^AF - fit the window size into the display size.

* split screen support
    A display may now host multiple windows.
    New commands:
      ^AS - split horizontally. This add another region to the display
      ^A<Tab> - move the focus to the next region
      ^AX - kill the current region
      ^AQ - kill all other regions

* hardstatus emulation support
    The last line of the display may now be used as a hardstatus
    line if the terminal doesn't have the 'hs' capability.
    New commands:
      hardstatus [always]lastline
      hardstatus [always]message
      hardstatus [always]ignore

* configurable window seperator and hardstatus strings
    The window (region) seperator and the hardstatus can be set to an
    arbitrary string containing screen's % escape sequences.
    The window's hardstatus is just another escape sequence, '%h'.
    New commands:
      hardstatus string [string]
      caption string [string]
    The default strings are "%h" (hardstatus) and "%3n %t" (caption).

* permanent window seperator
    The window seperator can be set to stay on screen even if
    the display contains only one region
    New commands:
      caption always
      caption splitonly

* many new escapes
    %c - current time HH:MM (*CHANGE*: this was %w in screen-3.7)
    %C - current time HH:MM in 24h format
    %l - the load of the system
    %h - hardstatus of the window
    %w - all window names
    %W - all window names except the current window
    %u - all other users on this window
    %? - the part to the next %? is displayed only if an escape
         expands to an nonempty string.
    %: - "else" part of %?
    Some escapes like %c may be qualified with a '0' (like %0c)
    to make screen use '0' instead of space as a filler.
    Others understand a length qualifier, like %3n.
    If escapes like the current time are used as hardstatus/caption
    string screen will update them so that you can always have
    the current time onscreen.
    *CHANGE* ~ is no longer used as bell character, use ^G instead!

* logfile timestamps and flush timeout
    New commands:
      logfile flush <secs>
      logtstamp [on|off]
      logtstamp string [string]
      logtstamp after [secs]

* configurable breaktype
    You can now choose one of TIOCSBRK, TCSBRK, tcsendbreak.
    New commands:
      breaktype
      defbreaktype

* other new commands:
    hstatus - set the window's hardstatus
    defslowpaste
    defsilence

* optional builtin telnet.
    This is useful if screen is used as frontend to a terminal
    multiplexor. Use //telnet to access the builtin telnet program,
    as in: 'screen //telnet host [port]'

* remote detach and reattach change:
    '-d' is now ignored if the screen is already detached and you
    want to reattach. You can also use '-RR' to make screen use
    the first session found if more than one session is available.
    Thus '-d -RR' or '-x -RR' always gets you a screen.

* support for history compaction
    You can tell screen to suppress trailing blank lines when
    scolling up text into the history buffer. (Wayne Davison)
    New command:
      compacthist

* optional Braille support. If you can read Braille and have one of
    the devices listed in README.DOTSCREEN, please compile with
    -DHAVE_BRAILLE and let us know if this feature is useful.



                  ----------------------------
                   What's new in screen-3.7 ?
                  ----------------------------

* Color support. Screen understands the following capabilities:
      AF (setaf) = Set foreground color (ANSI compatible)
      AB (setab) = Set background color (ANSI compatible)
      AX         = Does understand ANSI set default fg/bg color
                   (\E[39m / \E[49m)
    The tweaks for the color xterm would be:
      termcap  xterm 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
      terminfo xterm 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'

* New 'digraph' command (bound to ^A^V)
  ^A^Va" or ^A^V0344 input an a-umlaut

* activity/bell message strings can now include the window title:
    %t - title
    %n - number (a single % still works)

* 'defhstatus' command to give everey window a default
  hardstatus line. ^E is used as a string escape instead of %
  (see above). Try 'defhstatus "Screen: window ^E (^Et)"'

* Input parser changed to understand '^' (see ^E above).

Note that the linux color xterm has a stupid bug: the characters
get the color of the cursor, therefore if you change color and move
the cursor around all the characters will get the new color...
Here is a patch:
    pub/utilities/screen/color_xterm_patch
Btw.: rxvt works fine.

* Optional Braille support. If you can read Braille and have one of
  the devices listed in README.DOTSCREEN, please compile with
  -DHAVE_BRAILLE and let us know if this feature is useful.


                  ----------------------------
                   What's new in screen-3.6 ?
                  ----------------------------

* Input translation! This makes the vt100 emulation complete.
  As an addition it is now possible to bind any command to any
  (function-) key. See the man page for more details (bindkey
  command).

* Status line support. Each window can have a different status line.
  Use the ANSI APC string to set the status line, i.e.:
  <ESC>_<status string><ESC>\
  (For convenience the xterm sequence is also accepted.)
  You may want to add
    termcap  * '' ':hs:ts=\E_:fs=\E\\:ds=\E_\E\\:'
    terminfo * '' ':hs:ts=\E_:fs=\E\\:ds=\E_\E\\:'
  to your ~/.screenrc to make screen advertise the hardstatus
  support.

* Zombie feature added. Windows now may generate a message (with a
  timestamp) if they die and stay around until the user presses
  a key.

* New paste syntax: Paste can now concatenate registers and paste
  either on screen or in anouther register.
  This makes the old "ins_reg", "copy_reg" commands obsolete.

* More architecures supported. Screen now runs on AIX3.2.5,
  Solaris, NeXT and some other exotic platforms.

* Kanji support added. Screen understands JIS, EUC and SJIS coding.
  This is an experimental feature.

* GR charset switching (ISO 2022) implemented. Can be enabled with
  the "gr" command.

* C1 sequences implemented (see the "c1" command).

* Tek support from Xiaoguang Zhang. Apply tek.patch if you want to
  make screen pass tek sequences.

* List of new commands:
    bindkey, c1, command, defc1, defgr, defkanji, gr, kanji, mapdefault,
    mapnotnext, maptimeout, pastefont, printcmd, readreg, stuff, zombie

* Lots of other bugs fixed.


                  ----------------------------
                   What's new in screen-3.5 ?
                  ----------------------------


* Texinfo manpage! Thanks to Jason Merrill.

* Screen now has a very large 'configure' script. If you have
  problems with the resulting configuration please send mail to
  screen@uni-erlangen.de.

* Stackable overlay planes.
  All commands are available even if you work with an overlay. Thus
  you can be in copy/paste mode on several windows!

* Unification of key bindings and screen commands. All keys now generate
  commands.

* Screen now reads/writes only in asyncronous mode.

* Ansi parser speedup code resulting in much faster output of text.

* Changed the rc file syntax. Commands now directly affect the current
  window. The default settings are changed with 'def...' commands.
  The 'set' keyword no longer exists.
  Please run the 'newsyntax' script on your old screenrc files!

* Emacs style isearch added to copy mode. Try ^A ESC ^R screen ^R ^R
  to locate the last three occurences of the word 'screen' in the
  history buffer.

* New command 'silence'. Alarms the user whenever there was inactivity
  for a specified amount of time on a certain window.
  Useful if you want to wait for a compilation to end.

* Much better margin handling:
  Screen now handles autowrapped lines correctly in the redisplay and
  copy/paste functions.

* New commands for pastebuffer management:
  'copy_reg' copies the pastebuffer to a register,
  'ins_reg' pastes a register,
  'register' fills a register with a string,
  'process' stuffs a register into strings input queue.

* Autonuke feature. Flush the output buffer if the window gets
  cleared. Enable this with 'autonuke on'.

* Modifications to save memory: Empty attribute and font lines don't
  get allocated. This is very useful if you have a lage scrollback.

* Multi display support:
  You can now attach from more than one terminal to a session with
  the '-x' option.

* New option '-S' to specify socket name.

* Experimental multiuser support added:
  You can start screen in multiuser Mode by prepending the socket
  name with a '/' (or by the command 'multiuser on').
  If another user wants to attach to the screen session, he can do
  this by prepending the socketname with 'screenuser/'.
  Of course he must be in the access control list for a successful
  attach (see the acladd/acldel command).

* Extension to the 'screen' command: You can now specify tty lines
  instead of programs. This can be used for console management.
  Added the command 'break' to send a break to the tty line.
  Not really a new feature, but terminal initialisation  now works
  on suns.

* Input/output filters added. This has been implemented to allow the
  user to configure an open tty line, but got soon exended to allow
  all sorts of filters. For more information read the explanation
  of the 'exec' command in the man page and check the 'fdpat.ps'
  document.

* Screen can now be started detached (screen -d -m -S sockname).
  This is usefull if you want to start screen in your /etc/rc file
  (e.g. as a console multiplexer)

* Console grabbing added ('console on' command).

* Windows can now be selected by akas, too. (Per default bound to the
  >'< key.)

* New terminal capabiliteise CS/CE for cursorkey control.

* setenv/unsetenv commands added.

* Expansion of environment variables ($VAR) and terminal capabilities
  ($:TC:) in the screenrc files and detach messages.
  Example: pow_detach_msg "Session of \$LOGNAME \$:cr:\$:nl:ended."

* New commands:
  'hardcopydir' and 'logdir' to change the output directories,
  'partial' and 'allpartial' to make screen only refresh the line
  containing the cursor if a window is selected (useful for slow
  modem connections).

* Cleanup of the provided termcap/terminfo file. Please install
  the new one!

* The program 'terminfo/checktc.c' does a visual check of a
  termcap/terminfo entry. Please try it before calling screen and
  in a screen session.

* LOTS of bugfixes and code cleanup.

Thanks to all the beta testers who helped porting screen to at least
the following platforms: Ultrix, SunOS, Solaris, BSD43, linux, NEWSOS,
Irix, OSF/1, Harris CX/UX, hpux, dynix/ptx, AIX.
And even more thanks to the brave who attempted to use the 'exec'
command features.

*) Use gnulib's getloadavg.

*) -YBSD was automatically appended to CC for ULTRIX systems.
CC Should not be touched by the build system, as it is a
user defined variable.  Arguably, we could set -YBSD in
AM_CFLAGS, but frankly it is better left to the user to
define that value if needed.

*) UTMPOK should NOT be defined at configure time but
   should be determined at runtime

*) On OS X, the pam headers are in /usr/include/pam, not /usr/include/security.
   This checks for the location.

*) Add git revision to tarball name.  All revision number info is
   pulled from the git repository (via annotated tags.)

In updating the build, I anticipate some difficulties.  To
make my life easier, some compromises will be made and some
functionality will be sacrificed.  Hopefully not too much.
I hope to use this file to maintain a list of all the
changes I make that affect functionality.

*) The configure test for determining the load average is
very fragile.  It tests for systems rather than features,
and that means I cannot tell what it is looking for.  Rather
than sweating the details, I'm going to disable the loadavg
feature.  I'll do this via the configure script, so that
when I reasonable test is known it will be easy to replace.

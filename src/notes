In updating the build, I anticipate some difficulties.  To
make my life easier, some compromises will be made and some
functionality will be sacrificed.  Hopefully not too much.
I hope to use this file to maintain a list of all the
changes I make that affect functionality.

*) The configure test for determining the load average is
very fragile.  It tests for systems rather than features,
and that means I cannot tell what it is looking for.  Rather
than sweating the details, I'm going to disable the loadavg
feature.  I'll do this via the configure script, so that
when I reasonable test is known it will be easy to replace.

*) -YBSD was automatically appended to CC for ULTRIX systems.
CC Should not be touched by the build system, as it is a
user defined variable.  Arguably, we could set -YBSD in
AM_CFLAGS, but frankly it is better left to the user to
define that value if needed.

*) make dist in the master branch does not work
in a VPATH build.
